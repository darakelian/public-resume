# About This Repo
This repo contains my current public-facing, general-purpose resume written using LaTeX. Attribution for the templates can be found in the resume.cls file.

# Deployment Stack
Using GitHub Workflows, the resume is compiled and then deployed to a CloudFlare Pages custom domain which can be found [here](https://vec3d.xyz/resume.pdf)
